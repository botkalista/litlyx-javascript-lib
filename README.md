# LitLyx - Getting started, but Lit üî•

We, as developers, don't have much time to waste finding the exact KPI/Analytics tracker for our projects. We need something fast, efficient, a no-time-wasting technology that does that one thing exceptionally.

So let me introduce you LitLyx. üëâ<https://litlyx.com/>

# All You need to start in 1 min üëá

# Step 0 - Installation

You can install LitLyx using `npm`:

```sh
npm i litlyx
```

# Step 1 - Register an account on LitLyx

- go here üëâ<https://litlyx.com/>
- Sign.in an account with google login.
- Create a project.
- You have 1500 page visits / custom events for free.
- Get your first project id, you will need in the Step 2.
Easy ü§ë

# Step 2 - Choose your js/ts framework

No matter if you use Node.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js, Vue.js,React.js or even Bun.js we have you covered. 
Find all Supported Framework here: üëâ<https://litlyx.com/docs/supported_tech>

For semplicity, and because we develop our üî• crm with it, we will use Nuxt.js as an example.

Initialize litlyx.

```js
Lit.init('project_id');
```

You are ready to go for collecting page visits, countries, and devices to track.
We handle everything for you.
Websites urls or Sub-Pages changes are logged already on our crm. That's it. Pretty easy.

# Step 3 - log a custom event on your website or web app

Easy! Lit up the event like this:

```js
Lit.event('pretty_cool_event', metadata: {
    'name': 'LitLyx so lit, dude!',
});
```

Put as many custom events as you prefer. We suggest to have at least a gazilion events in your code, so you can break the internet with it ü´°

# Step 4 - see the real-time results on Lit Crm

"Okay, now you've put a gazillion events and you have like 1M views in a second on your website." Fair numbers, I will say. Explore the crm.

# We Finish you are ready to go!! 

Bravo, you've finished the setup and now you can be ultra-lit with your light, easy-to-use analytics tools; you will love them for sure.

# Well, we love open source 

Prova, Prova, sa, sa, Lit guy here, i forget to tell you that all the project is open source. We love contributors, so, dont be shy. Nobody will get roasted here, just Lit Up a bit. üî•

This project was made with üî• & ‚ù§Ô∏è in Italy. Share some love dafuq!!
